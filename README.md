# asdf-vm_update_maven_home
Fish shell script to update environment variable using asdf-vm to install maven.
this script was done based on the [java plugin](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java/blob/master/set-java-home.fish) and i use that to gat an easy way to use maven with asdf-vm in terminals with fish shell.
